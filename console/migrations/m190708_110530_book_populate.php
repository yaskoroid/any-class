Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter.\n\nFor a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country.\n\nAlthough I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,--a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter.\nAs Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, 'Let me see the child, and die.'\n\nThe surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed's head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him:\n\n'Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.'\n\n'Lor bless her dear heart, no!' interposed the nurse, hastily depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.\n\n'Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and had thirteen children of her own, and all on 'em dead except two, and them in the wurkus with me, she'll know better than to take on in that way, bless her dear heart! Think what it is to be a mother, there's a dear young lamb do.'\n\nApparently this consolatory perspective of a mother's prospects failed in producing its due effect. The patient shook her head, and stretched out her hand towards the child.\n\nThe surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back--and died. They chafed her breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever. They talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.\n\n'It's all over, Mrs. Thingummy!' said the surgeon at last.\n\n'Ah, poor dear, so it is!' said the nurse, picking up the cork of the green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to take up the child. 'Poor dear!'\n'You needn't mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,' said the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. 'It's very likely it WILL be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.' He put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door, added, 'She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?'\n\n'She was brought here last night,' replied the old woman, 'by the overseer's order. She was found lying in the street. She had walked some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.'\n\nThe surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand. 'The old story,' he said, shaking his head: 'no wedding-ring, I see. Ah! Good-night!'\n\nThe medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.\n\nWhat an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was! Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society. But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once--a parish child--the orphan of a workhouse--the humble, half-starved drudge--to be cuffed and buffeted through the world--despised by all, and pitied by none.\n\nOliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan, left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he would have cried the louder.\nFor the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception. He was brought up by hand. The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no female then domiciled in 'the house' who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need. The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be 'farmed,' or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week. Sevenpence-halfpenny's worth per week is a good round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself. So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher.\n\nEverybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air. Unfortunately for, the experimenal philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually attended the operation of HER system; for at the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this.

A Christmas Carol', It is important to remember that Jacob Marley was dead. Did Scrooge know that? Of course he did. Scrooge and Marley had been partners in London for many years, and excellent men of business they were, too. When Marley died, Scrooge continued with the business alone. Both names still stood above the office door: Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people who were new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley, but he answered to both names. He did not care what name they called him. The only thing that mattered to him was the business, and making money.\n\nOh! He was a hard, clever, mean old man, Scrooge was! There was nothing warm or open about him. He lived a secretive, lonely life, and took no interest in other people at all. The cold inside him made his eyes red, and his thin lips blue, and his voice high and cross. It put white frost on his old head, his eyebrows and his chin. The frost in his heart made the air around him cold, too. In the hottest days of summer his office was as cold as ice, and it was just as cold in winter.\n\nNobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with a happy smile, “My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to see me?” No poor man asked him for money, no children asked him the time, no man or woman ever, in all his life, asked him the way. Animals as well as people were afraid of him. Dogs used to hide in doorways when they saw him coming. But what did Scrooge care! It was just what he wanted. He liked being on the edge of people’s busy lives, while warning everyone to keep away from him.\nOne Christmas Eve, old Scrooge was working busily in his office. It was cold, frosty, foggy weather. Outside it was already dark, although it was only three o’clock in the afternoon, and there were candles in all the office windows. The fog covered everything, like a thick grey blanket.\nScrooge kept his office door open, in order to check that his clerk, Bob Cratchit, was working. Bob spent his days in a dark little room, a kind of cupboard, next to his employer’s office. Scrooge had a very small fire, but Bob’s fire was much smaller. It was very cold in the cupboard, and Bob had to wear his long white scarf to try to keep warm.\n\n“Merry Christmas, uncle! God bless you!” cried a happy voice. Scrooge’s nephew had arrived.\n“Bah!” said Scrooge crossly. “Humbug!”\n“Christmas is humbug! Surely you don’t mean that, uncle?” said his nephew.\n“I do,” said Scrooge. “Why do you call it “merry” Christmas? You’re too poor to be merry.”\n“Well,” replied the nephew, smiling, “why are you so cross? You’re too rich to be unhappy.”\n“Of course I’m cross,” answered the uncle, “when I live in a world full of stupid people like you! You say ‘Merry Christmas’! But what is Christmas? Just a time when you spend too much, when you find yourself a year older and not an hour richer, when you have to pay your bills. Everyone who goes around saying ‘Merry Christmas’ should have his tongue cut out. Yes, he should!”\n“Uncle! Please don’t say that!” said the nephew. “I’ve always thought of Christmas as a time to be helpful and kind to other people. It’s the only time of the year when men and women open their hearts freely to each other. And so, uncle, although I’ve never made any money from it, I think Christmas has been and will be a good time for me! And I say, God bless Christmas!”\nBob, in the cupboard, agreed loudly, without thinking. He immediately realized his mistake, and went quickly back to his work, but Scrooge had heard him.\n“If I hear another sound from you,” said Scrooge, “you’ll lose your job!”\n“Don’t be angry with him, uncle,” said the nephew. “Come and have dinner with us tomorrow.”\n“Dinner with you? I’ll see you dead first!”\n“But why won’t you come? Why?”\n“Because Christmas is humbug! Good afternoon!”\n“I want nothing from you. I ask nothing of you. Why can’t we be friends?”\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\n“I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you like this. I have never wanted to argue with you. But I came to see you and invite you because it’s Christmas, and so I’ll say, a merry Christmas, uncle!”\n“Good afternoon,” said Scrooge.\n“And a happy new year!”\n“Good afternoon!” said Scrooge.\nHis nephew left the room, without an angry word, stopping only to wish Bob Cratchit a merry Christmas.\nThen two other gentlemen came in. They were large, round, comfortable-looking men, with books and papers in their hands.\n“This is Scrooge and Marley’s, I think,” said one of them, looking at the papers that he was carrying. “Am I speaking to Mr Scrooge or Mr Marley?”\n“Mr Marley is dead,” Scrooge replied. “He died seven years ago today, on Christmas Eve.”\n“I’m sure that you are just as kind to the poor as your partner,” said the gentleman, smiling.\nWhat was true was that Scrooge was just as mean as Marley, and Marley had been just as mean as Scrooge.\n“At this happy time of year, Mr Scrooge,” the gentleman went on, taking up his pen, “we should help poor people who have no food or clothes or homes.”\n“Are there no prisons?” asked Scrooge coldly.\n“Plenty of prisons,” said the gentleman.\n“And the workhouses, where poor people can live and work? Are they still open?”\n“Yes, they are, I’m sorry to say.”\n“I’m happy to hear it,” said Scrooge. “I thought, from what you said at first, that perhaps these useful places were closed, for some reason.”\n“But some of us feel,” replied the gentleman, “that these places don’t offer enough to poor people. We’re hoping to give some meat and drink, and wood for a fire, to people who need all these things. This is a time when we should all be able to enjoy ourselves. How much will you give, sir?”\n“Nothing!” Scrooge replied. “I don’t have a merry Christmas myself, and I won’t pay for other people to be merry. We all have to pay for prisons and workhouses – they cost enough. The poor will have to go there.”\n“Many can’t go there, and many prefer to die.”\n“If they prefer to die, why don’t they die, then? There are too many people in the world, so it’s a good thing if some of them die. All this is none of my business! It’s enough for a man to understand his own business, and not to think about other people’s. I’m a very busy man. Good afternoon, gentlemen!”\nThe gentlemen shook their heads a little sadly, and left the office. Scrooge went back to his work, feeling pleased with himself.\nNow the fog was at its thickest outside, and the cold was biting. Lights shone brightly from the shop windows. People were hurrying here and there – rich and poor alike – to buy what they needed for tomorrow’s Christmas dinner.\nAt last it was time to close the office. Scrooge got up slowly from his desk. Bob was waiting for this moment, and he immediately put on his hat.\n“You’ll want a holiday all day tomorrow, I suppose?” said Scrooge.\n“If you don’t mind, sir.”\n“I do mind. It’s not fair. I have to pay you for a day’s work when you don’t do any work.”\n“It’s only once a year, sir,” said Bob politely.\n“That’s no reason for robbing me every twenty-fifth of December!” said Scrooge, putting on his coat. “But I suppose you must have it. Be here early next morning.”\n“Yes, sir, I will, I promise,” Bob said happily. Scrooge walked out, without another word. When Bob had closed the office, he ran home to his family in Camden Town as quickly as possible.\nScrooge always used to eat his dinner alone, in the same miserable little eating-house. Tonight was no different from other nights. He read the newspapers, looked at his bank books, and went home to bed. He lived in rooms which had once belonged to his dead partner. They were in an old, dark building in a lonely side street, where no one except Scrooge lived.\nIn the blackness of the night, through the fog and the frost, Scrooge had to feel his way along the street with his hands. He finally reached his front door and put the key in the lock. Suddenly, to his great surprise, he saw that the knocker was not a knocker any more, but had become the face of Jacob Marley!\n\nHe had not thought of his partner for seven years, until that afternoon, when he spoke Marley’s name to his visitors. But there in front of him was Marley’s face, white and ghostly, with terrible staring eyes.\nAs Scrooge looked, it became a knocker again. He was afraid, but he did not show his fear. He turned the key, opened the door and walked in. He did look around before he shut the door, and he did look behind the door, to see if anyone was hiding there. But there was nothing there. He shut the door with a bang, to show that he was not afraid.\nWith his one candle he went slowly up the stairs. It was impossible to see into all the dark corners. Darkness was cheap, and Scrooge liked it. But he remembered the face, so he walked through all his rooms, checking that everything was all right. Nobody under the table or the bed, nobody behind the door! On the small fire in the bedroom there was a pot of soup, and Scrooge’s bowl was ready on the table. Nobody in any of the rooms! Sure that he was safe now, Scrooge shut and locked his bedroom door behind him. He sat down by the fire to eat his soup.\n

        $theOriginOfSpecies = <<<DOC3
The Origin of Species', 'I WILL here give a brief sketch of the progress of opinion on \nthe Origin of Species. Until recently the great majority of \nnaturalists believed that species were immutable productions, \nand had been separately created. This view has been ably \nmaintained by many authors. Some few naturalists, on the \nother hand, have believed that species undergo modification, \nand that the existing forms of life are the descendants by \ntrue generation of pre-existing forms. Passing over allu- \nsions to the subject in the classical writers,* the first author \nwho in modern times has treated it in a scientific spirit was \nBuffon. But as his opinions fluctuated greatly at different \nperiods, and as he does not enter on the causes or means of \nthe transformation of species, I need not here enter on \ndetails. \n\n*Aristotle, in his ' Physicae Auscultationes ' (lib. 2, cap. 8, s. 2). after \nremarking that rain does not fall in order to make the corn grow, any more \nthan it falls to spoil the farmer's corn when threshed out of doors, applies \nthe same argument to organisation; and adds (as translated by Mr. Clair \nGrace, who first pointed out the passage to mc), "So what hinders the dif- \nferent parts [of the body] from having this merely accidental relation in \nnature? as the teeth, for example, grow by necessity, the front ones sharp, \nadapted for dividing, and the grinders flat, and serviceable for masticating \nthe food; since they were not made for the sake of this, but it was the \nresult of accident. And in like manner as to the other parts in which there \nappears to exist an adaptation to an end. Wheresoever, therefore, all things \ntogether (that is all the parts of one whole) happened like as if they were \nmade for the sake of something, these were preserved, having been appro- \npriately constituted by an internal spontaneity; and whatsoever things w;ere \nnot thus constituted, perished, and still perish." We here sec tiie principle \nof natural selection shadowed forth, but how little Aristotle fully compre- \nhended the principle, is shown by his remarks on the formation of the teeth. \n\n9 \n\n\n\n10 HISTORICAL SKETCH \n\nLamarck was the first man whose conclusions on the \nsubject excited much attention. This justly-celebrated nat- \nuralist first published his views in 1801 ; he much enlarged \nthem in 1809 in his 'Philosophic Zoologique,' and subse- \nquently, in 1815, in the Introduction to his 'Hist. Nat. des \nAnimaux sans Vertebres.' In these works he upholds the \ndoctrine that species, including man, are descended from \nother species. He first did the eminent service of arousing at- \ntention to the probability of all change in the organic, as well \nas in the inorganic world, being the result of law, and not of \nmiraculous interposition. Lamarck seems to have been chiefly \nled to his conclusion on the gradual change of species, by the \ndifficulty of distinguishing species and varieties, by the almost \nperfect gradation of forms in certain groups, and by the \nanalogy of domestic productions. With respect to the means \nof modification, he attributed something to the direct action \nof the physical conditions of life, something to the crossing of \nalready existing forms, and much to use and disuse, that is, \nto the efifects of habit. To this latter agency he seems to \nattribute all the beautiful adaptations in nature; — such as the \nlong neck of the giraffe for browsing on the branches of \ntrees. But he likewise believed in a law of progressive de- \nvelopment; and as all the forms of life thus tend to progress, \nin order to account for the existence at the present day of \nsimple productions, he maintains that such forms are now \nspontaneously generated.* \n\nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire, as is stated in his 'Life,' written \nby his son, suspected, as early as 1795, that what we call \nspecies are various degenerations of the same type. It was \n\n* I have taken the date of the first publication of Lamarck from Isid. \nGeoffroy Saint-Hilaire]s ('Hist. Nat. Generale,' torn, ii, p. 405, 1859) \nexcellent history of opinion on this subject. In this work a full account is \ngiven of Buffon's conclusions on the same subject. It is curious how largely \nmy grandfather, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, anticipated the views and erroneous \ngrounds of opinion of Lamarck in his ' Zoonomia ' (vol. i. pp. 500-510), pub- \nlished in 1794. According to Isid. Geoffroy there is no doubt that Goethe \nwas an extreme partisan of similar views, as shown in the Introduction to a \nwork written in 1794 and 1795, but not published till long afterwards: he \nhas pointedly remarked (' Goethe als Naturforscher,' von Dr. Karl Meding, \ns. 34) that the future question for naturalists will be how, for instance, \ncattle got their horns, and not for what they are used. It is rather a singu- \nlar instance of the manner in which similar views arise at about the same \ntime, that Goethe in Germany, Dr. Darwin in England, and Geoffroy Saint- \nHilaire (as we shall immediately see) in France, came to the same conclu- \nsion on the origin of species, in the years 1794-5. \n\n\n\nHISTORICAL SKETCH U \n\nnot until 1828 that he published his conviction that the same \nforms have not been perpetuated since the origin of all \nthings. Geoffroy seems to have relied chiefly on the condi- \ntion of life, or the "monde ambiant" as the cause of change. \nHe was cautious in drawing conclusions, and did not believe \nthat existing species are now undergoing modification; and, \nas his son adds, "C'est done un probleme a reserver \nentierement a I'avenir, suppose meme que I'avenir doive avoir \nprise sur lui." \n\nIn 1813, Dr. W. C. Wells read before the Royal Society \n'An Account of a White female, part of whose skin re- \nsembles that of a Negro' ; but his paper was not published \nuntil his famous * Two Essays upon Dew and Single Vision' \nappeared in 1818. In this paper he distinctly recognises the \nprinciple of natural selection, and this is the first recognition \nwhich has been indicated ; but he applies it only to the races of \nman, and to certain characters alone. After remarking that \nnegroes and mulattoes enjoy an immunity from certain trop- \nical diseases, he observes, firstly, that all animals tend to vary \nin some degree, and, secondly, that agriculturists improve \ntheir domesticated animals by selection ; and then, he adds, \nbut what is done in this latter case ''by art, seems to be done \nwith equal efficacy, though more slowly, by nature, in the \nformation of varieties of mankind, fitted for the country \nwhich they inhabit. Of the accidental varieties of man, \nwhich would occur among the first few and scattered inhab- \nitants of the middle regions of Africa, some one would be \nbetter fitted than the others to bear the diseases of the coun- \ntry. This race would consequently multiply, while the others \nwould decrease; not only from their inability to sustain the \nattacks of disease, but from their incapacity of contending \nwith their more vigorous neighbours. The colour of this \nvigorous race I take for granted, from what has been already \nsaid, would be dark. But the same disposition to form varie- \nties still existing, a darker and a darker race would in the \ncourse of time occur : and as the darkest would be the best \nfitted for the climate, this would at length become the most \nprevalent, if not the only race, in the particular country in \nwhich it had originated." He then extends these same views \nto the white inhabitants of colder climates. I am indebted \n\n

        $theAdventuresOfTomSawyer = <<<DOC4
PREFACE\n\n\nMost of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life; Tom Sawyer also, but not from an individual—he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom I knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.\n\nThe odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among children and slaves in the West at the period of this story—that is to say, thirty or forty years ago.\n\nAlthough my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys and girls, I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that account, for part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of what they once were themselves, and of how they felt and thought and talked, and what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in.\n\nTHE AUTHOR.\n\nHARTFORD, 1876.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n“TOM!”\n\nNo answer.\n\n“TOM!”\n\nNo answer.\n\n“What’s gone with that boy, I wonder? You TOM!”\n\nNo answer.\n\nThe old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about the room; then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom or never looked through them for so small a thing as a boy; they were her state pair, the pride of her heart, and were built for “style,” not service—she could have seen through a pair of stove-lids just as well. She looked perplexed for a moment, and then said, not fiercely, but still loud enough for the furniture to hear:\n\n“Well, I lay if I get hold of you I’ll—”\n\nShe did not finish, for by this time she was bending down and punching under the bed with the broom, and so she needed breath to punctuate the punches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.\n\n“I never did see the beat of that boy!”\n\nShe went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among the tomato vines and “jimpson” weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom. So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance and shouted:\n\n“Y-o-u-u TOM!”\n\nThere was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time to seize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.\n\n“There! I might ’a’ thought of that closet. What you been doing in there?”\n\n“Nothing.”\n\n“Nothing! Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What is that truck?”\n\n“I don’t know, aunt.”\n\n“Well, I know. It’s jam—that’s what it is. Forty times I’ve said if you didn’t let that jam alone I’d skin you. Hand me that switch.”\n\nThe switch hovered in the air—the peril was desperate—\n\n“My! Look behind you, aunt!”\n\nThe old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger. The lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and disappeared over it.\n\nHis aunt Polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle laugh.\n\n“Hang the boy, can’t I never learn anything? Ain’t he played me tricks enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? But old fools is the biggest fools there is. Can’t learn an old dog new tricks, as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days, and how is a body to know what’s coming? He ’pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it’s all down again and I can’t hit him a lick. I ain’t doing my duty by that boy, and that’s the Lord’s truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says. I’m a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I know. He’s full of the Old Scratch, but laws-a-me! he’s my own dead sister’s boy, poor thing, and I ain’t got the heart to lash him, somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well-a-well, man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says, and I reckon it’s so. He’ll play hookey this evening, * and [* Southwestern for “afternoon”] I’ll just be obleeged to make him work, tomorrow, to punish him. It’s mighty hard to make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he hates anything else, and I’ve got to do some of my duty by him, or I’ll be the ruination of the child.”\n\nTom did play hookey, and he had a very good time. He got back home barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next-day’s wood and split the kindlings before supper—at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three-fourths of the work. Tom’s younger brother (or rather half-brother) Sid was already through with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy, and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.\n\nWhile Tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity offered, Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and very deep—for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Like many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low cunning. Said she:\n\n“Tom, it was middling warm in school, warn’t it?”\n\n“Yes’m.”\n\n“Powerful warm, warn’t it?”\n\n“Yes’m.”\n\n“Didn’t you want to go in a-swimming, Tom?”\n\nA bit of a scare shot through Tom—a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. He searched Aunt Polly’s face, but it told him nothing. So he said:\n\n“No’m—well, not very much.”\n\nThe old lady reached out her hand and felt Tom’s shirt, and said:\n\n“But you ain’t too warm now, though.” And it flattered her to reflect that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing that that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her, Tom knew where the wind lay, now. So he forestalled what might be the next move:\n\n“Some of us pumped on our heads—mine’s damp yet. See?”\n\nAunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. Then she had a new inspiration:\n\n“Tom, you didn’t have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it, to pump on your head, did you? Unbutton your jacket!”\n\nThe trouble vanished out of Tom’s face. He opened his jacket. His shirt collar was securely sewed.\n\n“Bother! Well, go ’long with you. I’d made sure you’d played hookey and been a-swimming. But I forgive ye, Tom. I reckon you’re a kind of a singed cat, as the saying is—better’n you look. This time.”\n\nShe was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried, and half glad that Tom had stumbled into obedient conduct for once.\n\nBut Sidney said:\n\n“Well, now, if I didn’t think you sewed his collar with white thread, but it’s black.”\n\n“Why, I did sew it with white! Tom!”\n\nBut Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he said:\n\n“Siddy, I’ll lick you for that.”\n\nIn a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust into the lapels of his jacket, and had thread bound about them—one needle carried white thread and the other black. He said:\n\n“She’d never noticed if it hadn’t been for Sid. Confound it! sometimes she sews it with white, and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish to gee-miny she’d stick to one or t’other—I can’t keep the run of ’em. But I bet you I’ll lam Sid for that. I’ll learn him!”\n\nHe was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy very well though—and loathed him.\n\nWithin two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man’s are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time—just as men’s misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it un-disturbed. It consisted in a peculiar bird-like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music—the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet—no doubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the astronomer.\n\nThe summer evenings were long. It was not dark, yet. Presently Tom checked his whistle. A stranger was before him—a boy a shade larger than himself. A new-comer of any age or either sex was an im-pressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy was well dressed, too—well dressed on a week-day. This was simply astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close-buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes on—and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom’s vitals. The more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved—but only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time. Finally Tom said:

Chapter I. TOM SEEKS NEW ADVENTURES\n\nDO you reckon Tom Sawyer was satisfied after all them adventures? I mean the adventures we had down the river, and the time we set the darky Jim free and Tom got shot in the leg. No, he wasn’t. It only just p’isoned him for more. That was all the effect it had. You see, when we three came back up the river in glory, as you may say, from that long travel, and the village received us with a torchlight procession and speeches, and everybody hurrah’d and shouted, it made us heroes, and that was what Tom Sawyer had always been hankering to be.\nFor a while he WAS satisfied. Everybody made much of him, and he tilted up his nose and stepped around the town as though he owned it. Some called him Tom Sawyer the Traveler, and that just swelled him up fit to bust. You see he laid over me and Jim considerable, because we only went down the river on a raft and came back by the steamboat, but Tom went by the steamboat both ways. The boys envied me and Jim a good deal, but land! they just knuckled to the dirt before TOM.\nWell, I don’t know; maybe he might have been satisfied if it hadn’t been for old Nat Parsons, which was postmaster, and powerful long and slim, and kind o’ good-hearted and silly, and bald-headed, on account of his age, and about the talkiest old cretur I ever see. For as much as thirty years he’d been the only man in the village that had a reputation—I mean a reputation for being a traveler, and of course he was mortal proud of it, and it was reckoned that in the course of that thirty years he had told about that journey over a million times and enjoyed it every time. And now comes along a boy not quite fifteen, and sets everybody admiring and gawking over HIS travels, and it just give the poor old man the high strikes. It made him sick to listen to Tom, and to hear the people say “My land!” “Did you ever!” “My goodness sakes alive!” and all such things; but he couldn’t pull away from it, any more than a fly that’s got its hind leg fast in the molasses. And always when Tom come to a rest, the poor old cretur would chip in on HIS same old travels and work them for all they were worth; but they were pretty faded, and didn’t go for much, and it was pitiful to see. And then Tom would take another innings, and then the old man again—and so on, and so on, for an hour and more, each trying to beat out the other.\nYou see, Parsons’ travels happened like this: When he first got to be postmaster and was green in the business, there come a letter for somebody he didn’t know, and there wasn’t any such person in the village. Well, he didn’t know what to do, nor how to act, and there the letter stayed and stayed, week in and week out, till the bare sight of it gave him a conniption. The postage wasn’t paid on it, and that was another thing to worry about. There wasn’t any way to collect that ten cents, and he reckon’d the gov’ment would hold him responsible for it and maybe turn him out besides, when they found he hadn’t collected it. Well, at last he couldn’t stand it any longer. He couldn’t sleep nights, he couldn’t eat, he was thinned down to a shadder, yet he da’sn’t ask anybody’s advice, for the very person he asked for advice might go back on him and let the gov’ment know about the letter. He had the letter buried under the floor, but that did no good; if he happened to see a person standing over the place it’d give him the cold shivers, and loaded him up with suspicions, and he would sit up that night till the town was still and dark, and then he would sneak there and get it out and bury it in another place. Of course, people got to avoiding him and shaking their heads and whispering, because, the way he was looking and acting, they judged he had killed somebody or done something terrible, they didn’t know what, and if he had been a stranger they would’ve lynched him.\nWell, as I was saying, it got so he couldn’t stand it any longer; so he made up his mind to pull out for Washington, and just go to the President of the United States and make a clean breast of the whole thing, not keeping back an atom, and then fetch the letter out and lay it before the whole gov’ment, and say, “Now, there she is—do with me what you’re a mind to; though as heaven is my judge I am an innocent man and not deserving of the full penalties of the law and leaving behind me a family that must starve and yet hadn’t had a thing to do with it, which is the whole truth and I can swear to it.”\nSo he did it. He had a little wee bit of steamboating, and some stage-coaching, but all the rest of the way was horseback, and it took him three weeks to get to Washington. He saw lots of land and lots of villages and four cities. He was gone ‘most eight weeks, and there never was such a proud man in the village as he when he got back. His travels made him the greatest man in all that region, and the most talked about; and people come from as much as thirty miles back in the country, and from over in the Illinois bottoms, too, just to look at him—and there they’d stand and gawk, and he’d gabble. You never see anything like it.\nWell, there wasn’t any way now to settle which was the greatest traveler; some said it was Nat, some said it was Tom. Everybody allowed that Nat had seen the most longitude, but they had to give in that whatever Tom was short in longitude he had made up in latitude and climate. It was about a stand-off; so both of them had to whoop up their dangerous adventures, and try to get ahead THAT way. That bullet-wound in Tom’s leg was a tough thing for Nat Parsons to buck against, but he bucked the best he could; and at a disadvantage, too, for Tom didn’t set still as he’d orter done, to be fair, but always got up and sauntered around and worked his limp while Nat was painting up the adventure that HE had in Washington; for Tom never let go that limp when his leg got well, but practiced it nights at home, and kept it good as new right along.\nNat’s adventure was like this; I don’t know how true it is; maybe he got it out of a paper, or somewhere, but I will say this for him, that he DID know how to tell it. He could make anybody’s flesh crawl, and he’d turn pale and hold his breath when he told it, and sometimes women and girls got so faint they couldn’t stick it out. Well, it was this way, as near as I can remember:\nHe come a-loping into Washington, and put up his horse and shoved out to the President’s house with his letter, and they told him the President was up to the Capitol, and just going to start for Philadelphia—not a minute to lose if he wanted to catch him. Nat ‘most dropped, it made him so sick. His horse was put up, and he didn’t know what to do. But just then along comes a darky driving an old ramshackly hack, and he see his chance. He rushes out and shouts: “A half a dollar if you git me to the Capitol in half an hour, and a quarter extra if you do it in twenty minutes!”\n“Done!” says the darky.\nNat he jumped in and slammed the door, and away they went a-ripping and a-tearing over the roughest road a body ever see, and the racket of it was something awful. Nat passed his arms through the loops and hung on for life and death, but pretty soon the hack hit a rock and flew up in the air, and the bottom fell out, and when it come down Nat’s feet was on the ground, and he see he was in the most desperate danger if he couldn’t keep up with the hack. He was horrible scared, but he laid into his work for all he was worth, and hung tight to the arm-loops and made his legs fairly fly. He yelled and shouted to the driver to stop, and so did the crowds along the street, for they could see his legs spinning along under the coach, and his head and shoulders bobbing inside through the windows, and he was in awful danger; but the more they all shouted the more the nigger whooped and yelled and lashed the horses and shouted, “Don’t you fret, I’se gwine to git you dah in time, boss; I’s gwine to do it, sho’!” for you see he thought they were all hurrying him up, and, of course, he couldn’t hear anything for the racket he was making. And so they went ripping along, and everybody just petrified to see it; and when they got to the Capitol at last it was the quickest trip that ever was made, and everybody said so. The horses laid down, and Nat dropped, all tuckered out, and he was all dust and rags and barefooted; but he was in time and just in time, and caught the President and give him the letter, and everything was all right, and the President give him a free pardon on the spot, and Nat give the nigger two extra quarters instead of one, because he could see that if he hadn’t had the hack he wouldn’t’a’ got there in time, nor anywhere near it.\nIt WAS a powerful good adventure, and Tom Sawyer had to work his bullet-wound mighty lively to hold his own against it.\nWell, by and by Tom’s glory got to paling down gradu’ly, on account of other things turning up for the people to talk about—first a horse-race, and on top of that a house afire, and on top of that the circus, and on top of that the eclipse; and that started a revival, same as it always does, and by that time there wasn’t any more talk about Tom, so to speak, and you never see a person so sick and disgusted.\nPretty soon he got to worrying and fretting right along day in and day out, and when I asked him what WAS he in such a state about, he said it ‘most broke his heart to think how time was slipping away, and him getting older and older, and no wars breaking out and no way of making a name for himself that he could see. Now that is the way boys is always thinking, but he was the first one I ever heard come out and say it.\nSo then he set to work to get up a plan to make him celebrated; and pretty soon he struck it, and offered to take me and Jim in. Tom Sawyer was always free and generous that way. There’s a-plenty of boys that’s mighty good and friendly when YOU’VE got a good thing, but when a good thing happens to come their way they don’t say a word to you, and try to hog it all. That warn’t ever Tom Sawyer’s way, I can say that for him. There’s plenty of boys that will come hankering and groveling around you when you’ve got an apple and beg the core off of you; but when they’ve got one, and you beg for the core and remind them how you give them a core one time, they say thank you ‘most to death, but there ain’t a-going to be no core. But I notice they always git come up with; all you got to do is to wait.\nWell, we went out in the woods on the hill, and Tom told us what it was. It was a crusade.\n“What’s a crusade?” I says.\nHe looked scornful, the way he’s always done when he was ashamed of a person, and says:\n“Huck Finn, do you mean to tell me you don’t know what a crusade is?”\n“No,” says I, “I don’t. And I don’t care to, nuther. I’ve lived till now and done without it, and had my health, too. But as soon as you tell me, I’ll know, and that’s soon enough. I don’t see any use in finding out things and clogging up my head with them when I mayn’t ever have any occasion to use ’em. There was Lance Williams, he learned how to talk Choctaw here till one come and dug his grave for him. Now, then, what’s a crusade? But I can tell you one thing before you begin; if it’s a patent-right, there’s no money in it. Bill Thompson he—”\n“Patent-right!” says he. “I never see such an idiot. Why, a crusade is a kind of war.”\nI thought he must be losing his mind. But no, he was in real earnest, and went right on, perfectly ca’m.\n“A crusade is a war to recover the Holy Land from the paynim.”\n“Which Holy Land?”\n“Why, the Holy Land—there ain’t but one.”\n“What do we want of it?”\n“Why, can’t you understand? It’s in the hands of the paynim, and it’s our duty to take it away from them.”\n“How did we come to let them git hold of it?”\n“We didn’t come to let them git hold of it. They always had it.”\n“Why, Tom, then it must belong to them, don’t it?”\n“Why of course it does. Who said it didn’t?”\nI studied over it, but couldn’t seem to git at the right of it, no way. I says:\n“It’s too many for me, Tom Sawyer. If I had a farm and it was mine, and another person wanted it, would it be right for him to—”\n“Oh, shucks! you don’t know enough to come in when it rains, Huck Finn. It ain’t a farm, it’s entirely different. You see, it’s like this. They own the land, just the mere land, and that’s all they DO own; but it was our folks, our Jews and Christians, that made it holy, and so they haven’t any business to be there defiling it. It’s a shame, and we ought not to stand it a minute. We ought to march against them and take it away from them.”\n“Why, it does seem to me it’s the most mixed-up thing I ever see! Now, if I had a farm and another person—”\n“Don’t I tell you it hasn’t got anything to do with farming? Farming is business, just common low-down business: that’s all it is, it’s all you can say for it; but this is higher, this is religious, and totally different.”\n“Religious to go and take the land away from people that owns it?”\n“Certainly; it’s always been considered so.”\nJim he shook his head, and says:\n“Mars Tom, I reckon dey’s a mistake about it somers—dey mos’ sholy is. I’s religious myself, en I knows plenty religious people, but I hain’t run across none dat acts like dat.”\nIt made Tom hot, and he says:\n“Well, it’s enough to make a body sick, such mullet-headed ignorance! If either of you’d read anything about history, you’d know that Richard Cur de Loon, and the Pope, and Godfrey de Bulleyn, and lots more of the most noble-hearted and pious people in the world, hacked and hammered at the paynims for more than two hundred years trying to take their land away from them, and swum neck-deep in blood the whole time—and yet here’s a couple of sap-headed country yahoos out in the backwoods of Missouri setting themselves up to know more about the rights and wrongs of it than they did! Talk about cheek!”\nWell, of course, that put a more different light on it, and me and Jim felt pretty cheap and ignorant, and wished we hadn’t been quite so chipper. I couldn’t say nothing, and Jim he couldn’t for a while; then he says:\n“Well, den, I reckon it’s all right; beca’se ef dey didn’t know, dey ain’t no use for po’ ignorant folks like us to be trying to know; en so, ef it’s our duty, we got to go en tackle it en do de bes’ we can. Same time, I feel as sorry for dem paynims as Mars Tom. De hard part gwine to be to kill folks dat a body hain’t been ‘quainted wid and dat hain’t done him no harm. Dat’s it, you see. Ef we wuz to go ‘mongst ’em, jist we three, en say we’s hungry, en ast ’em for a bite to eat, why, maybe dey’s jist like yuther people. Don’t you reckon dey is? Why, DEY’D give it, I know dey would, en den—”\n“Then what?”\n“Well, Mars Tom, my idea is like dis. It ain’t no use, we CAN’T kill dem po’ strangers dat ain’t doin’ us no harm, till we’ve had practice—I knows it perfectly well, Mars Tom—’deed I knows it perfectly well. But ef we takes a’ axe or two, jist you en me en Huck, en slips acrost de river to-night arter de moon’s gone down, en kills dat sick fam’ly dat’s over on the Sny, en burns dey house down, en—”\n“Oh, you make me tired!” says Tom. “I don’t want to argue any more with people like you and Huck Finn, that’s always wandering from the subject, and ain’t got any more sense than to try to reason out a thing that’s pure theology by the laws that protect real estate!”\nNow that’s just where Tom Sawyer warn’t fair. Jim didn’t mean no harm, and I didn’t mean no harm. We knowed well enough that he was right and we was wrong, and all we was after was to get at the HOW of it, and that was all; and the only reason he couldn’t explain it so we could understand it was because we was ignorant—yes, and pretty dull, too, I ain’t denying that; but, land! that ain’t no crime, I should think.

CHAPTER I. AN INVITATION FOR TOM AND HUCK\n\n  [Note: Strange as the incidents of this story are, they are not inventions, but facts--even to the public confession of the accused. I take them from an old-time Swedish criminal trial, change the actors, and transfer the scenes to America. I have added some details, but only a couple of them are important ones. -- M. T.]\n\n  WELL, it was the next spring after me and Tom Sawyer set our old niggerJim free, the time he was chained up for a runaway slave down there onTom's uncle Silas's farm in Arkansaw. The frost was working out of theground, and out of the air, too, and it was getting closer and closeronto barefoot time every day; and next it would be marble time, and nextmumbletypeg, and next tops and hoops, and next kites, and then rightaway it would be summer and going in a-swimming. It just makes a boyhomesick to look ahead like that and see how far off summer is. Yes, andit sets him to sighing and saddening around, and there's something thematter with him, he don't know what. But anyway, he gets out by himselfand mopes and thinks; and mostly he hunts for a lonesome place high upon the hill in the edge of the woods, and sets there and looks away offon the big Mississippi down there a-reaching miles and miles around thepoints where the timber looks smoky and dim it's so far off and still,and everything's so solemn it seems like everybody you've loved is deadand gone, and you 'most wish you was dead and gone too, and done with itall.\n\n  Don't you know what that is? It's spring fever. That is what the name ofit is. And when you've got it, you want--oh, you don't quite know whatit is you DO want, but it just fairly makes your heart ache, you want itso! It seems to you that mainly what you want is to get away; get awayfrom the same old tedious things you're so used to seeing and so tiredof, and set something new. That is the idea; you want to go and be awanderer; you want to go wandering far away to strange countries whereeverything is mysterious and wonderful and romantic. And if you can't dothat, you'll put up with considerable less; you'll go anywhere you CANgo, just so as to get away, and be thankful of the chance, too.\n\n  Well, me and Tom Sawyer had the spring fever, and had it bad, too; butit warn't any use to think about Tom trying to get away, because, as hesaid, his Aunt Polly wouldn't let him quit school and go traipsing offsomers wasting time; so we was pretty blue. We was setting on the frontsteps one day about sundown talking this way, when out comes his auntPolly with a letter in her hand and says:\n\n  "Tom, I reckon you've got to pack up and go down to Arkansaw--your auntSally wants you."\n\n  I 'most jumped out of my skin for joy. I reckoned Tom would fly at hisaunt and hug her head off; but if you believe me he set there like arock, and never said a word. It made me fit to cry to see him act sofoolish, with such a noble chance as this opening up. Why, we might loseit if he didn't speak up and show he was thankful and grateful. But heset there and studied and studied till I was that distressed I didn'tknow what to do; then he says, very ca'm, and I could a shot him for it:\n\n  "Well," he says, "I'm right down sorry, Aunt Polly, but I reckon I gotto be excused--for the present."\n\n  His aunt Polly was knocked so stupid and so mad at the cold impudence ofit that she couldn't say a word for as much as a half a minute, and thisgave me a chance to nudge Tom and whisper:\n\n  "Ain't you got any sense? Sp'iling such a noble chance as this andthrowing it away?"\n\n  But he warn't disturbed. He mumbled back:\n\n  "Huck Finn, do you want me to let her SEE how bad I want to go? Why,she'd begin to doubt, right away, and imagine a lot of sicknesses anddangers and objections, and first you know she'd take it all back. Youlemme alone; I reckon I know how to work her."\n\n  Now I never would 'a' thought of that. But he was right. Tom Sawyer wasalways right--the levelest head I ever see, and always AT himself andready for anything you might spring on him. By this time his aunt Pollywas all straight again, and she let fly. She says:\n\n  "You'll be excused! YOU will! Well, I never heard the like of it in allmy days! The idea of you talking like that to ME! Now take yourself offand pack your traps; and if I hear another word out of you about whatyou'll be excused from and what you won't, I lay I'LL excuse you--with ahickory!"\n\n  She hit his head a thump with her thimble as we dodged by, and he let onto be whimpering as we struck for the stairs. Up in his room hehugged me, he was so out of his head for gladness because he was goingtraveling. And he says:\n\n  "Before we get away she'll wish she hadn't let me go, but she won't knowany way to get around it now. After what she's said, her pride won't lether take it back."\n\n  Tom was packed in ten minutes, all except what his aunt and Mary wouldfinish up for him; then we waited ten more for her to get cooled downand sweet and gentle again; for Tom said it took her ten minutes tounruffle in times when half of her feathers was up, but twenty when theywas all up, and this was one of the times when they was all up. Then wewent down, being in a sweat to know what the letter said.\n\n  She was setting there in a brown study, with it laying in her lap. Weset down, and she says:\n\n  "They're in considerable trouble down there, and they think you andHuck'll be a kind of diversion for them--'comfort,' they say. Much ofthat they'll get out of you and Huck Finn, I reckon. There's a neighbornamed Brace Dunlap that's been wanting to marry their Benny for threemonths, and at last they told him point blank and once for all, heCOULDN'T; so he has soured on them, and they're worried about it. Ireckon he's somebody they think they better be on the good side of, forthey've tried to please him by hiring his no-account brother to helpon the farm when they can't hardly afford it, and don't want him aroundanyhow. Who are the Dunlaps?"\n\n  "They live about a mile from Uncle Silas's place, Aunt Polly--all thefarmers live about a mile apart down there--and Brace Dunlap is a longsight richer than any of the others, and owns a whole grist of niggers.He's a widower, thirty-six years old, without any children, and is proudof his money and overbearing, and everybody is a little afraid of him. Ijudge he thought he could have any girl he wanted, just for the asking,and it must have set him back a good deal when he found he couldn't getBenny. Why, Benny's only half as old as he is, and just as sweet andlovely as--well, you've seen her. Poor old Uncle Silas--why, it's pitiful,him trying to curry favor that way--so hard pushed and poor, and yethiring that useless Jubiter Dunlap to please his ornery brother."\n\n  "What a name--Jubiter! Where'd he get it?"\n\n  "It's only just a nickname. I reckon they've forgot his real name longbefore this. He's twenty-seven, now, and has had it ever since the firsttime he ever went in swimming. The school teacher seen a round brownmole the size of a dime on his left leg above his knee, and four littlebits of moles around it, when he was naked, and he said it minded himof Jubiter and his moons; and the children thought it was funny, and sothey got to calling him Jubiter, and he's Jubiter yet. He's tall,and lazy, and sly, and sneaky, and ruther cowardly, too, but kind ofgood-natured, and wears long brown hair and no beard, and hasn't got acent, and Brace boards him for nothing, and gives him his old clothes towear, and despises him. Jubiter is a twin."\n\n  "What's t'other twin like?"\n\n  "Just exactly like Jubiter--so they say; used to was, anyway, but hehain't been seen for \n\n \nseven years. He got to robbing when he was nineteenor twenty, and they jailed him; but he broke jail and got away--up Northhere, somers. They used to hear about him robbing and burglaring now andthen, but that was years ago. He's dead, now. At least that's what theysay. They don't hear about him any more."\n\n  "What was his name?"\n\n  "Jake."\n\n  There wasn't anything more said for a considerable while; the old ladywas thinking. At last she says:\n\n  "The thing that is mostly worrying your aunt Sally is the tempers thatthat man Jubiter gets your uncle into."\n\n  Tom was astonished, and so was I. Tom says:\n\n  "Tempers? Uncle Silas? Land, you must be joking! I didn't know he HADany temper."\n\n  "Works him up into perfect rages, your aunt Sally says; says he acts asif he would really hit the man, sometimes."\n\n  "Aunt Polly, it beats anything I ever heard of. Why, he's just as gentleas mush."\n\n  "Well, she's worried, anyway. Says your uncle Silas is like a changedman, on account of all this quarreling. And the neighbors talk about it,and lay all the blame on your uncle, of course, because he's a preacherand hain't got any business to quarrel. Your aunt Sally says he hatesto go into the pulpit he's so ashamed; and the people have begun to cooltoward him, and he ain't as popular now as he used to was."\n\n  "Well, ain't it strange? Why, Aunt Polly, he was always so good and kindand moony and absent-minded and chuckle-headed and lovable--why, he wasjust an angel! What CAN be the matter of him, do you reckon?"

It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of Victory Mansions, though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering along with him.\nThe hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. At one end of it a coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall. It depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustache and ruggedly handsome features. Winston made for the stairs. It was no use trying the lift. Even at the best of times it was seldom working, and at present the electric current was cut off during daylight hours. It was part of the economy drive in preparation for Hate Week. The flat was seven flights up, and Winston, who was thirty-nine and had a varicose ulcer above his right ankle, went slowly, resting several times on the way. On each landing, opposite the lift-shaft, the poster with the enormous face gazed from the wall. It was one of those pictures which are so contrived that the eyes follow you about when you move. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption beneath it ran.\nInside the flat a fruity voice was reading out a list of figures which had something to do with the production of pig-iron. The voice came from an oblong metal plaque like a dulled mirror which formed part of the surface of the right-hand wall. Winston turned a switch and the voice sank somewhat, though the words were still distinguishable. The instrument (the telescreen, it was called) could be dimmed, but there was no way of shutting it off completely. He moved over to the window: a smallish, frail figure, the meagreness of his body merely emphasized by the blue overalls which were the uniform of the party. His hair was very fair, his face naturally sanguine, his skin roughened by coarse soap and blunt razor blades and the cold of the winter that had just ended.\nOutside, even through the shut window-pane, the world looked cold. Down in the street little eddies of wind were whirling dust and torn paper into spirals, and though the sun was shining and the sky a harsh blue, there seemed to be no colour in anything, except the posters that were plastered everywhere. The blackmoustachio'd face gazed down from every commanding corner. There was one on the house-front immediately opposite. BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU, the caption said, while the dark eyes looked deep into Winston's own. Down at street level another poster, torn at one corner, flapped fitfully in the wind, alternately covering and uncovering the single word INGSOC. In the far distance a helicopter skimmed down between the roofs, hovered for an instant like a bluebottle, and darted away again with a curving flight. It was the police patrol, snooping into people's windows. The patrols did not matter, however. Only the Thought Police mattered.\nBehind Winston's back the voice from the telescreen was still babbling away about pig-iron and the overfulfilment of the Ninth Three-Year Plan. The telescreen received and transmitted simultaneously. Any sound that Winston made, above the level of a very low whisper, would be picked up by it, moreover, so long as he remained within the field of vision which the metal plaque commanded, he could be seen as well as heard. There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time. But at any rate they could plug in your wire whenever they wanted to. You had to live — did live, from habit that became instinct — in the assumption that every sound you made was overheard, and, except in darkness, every movement scrutinized.\nWinston kept his back turned to the telescreen. It was safer, though, as he well knew, even a back can be revealing. A kilometre away the Ministry of Truth, his place of work, towered vast and white above the grimy landscape. This, he thought with a sort of vague distaste — this was London, chief city of Airstrip One, itself the third most populous of the provinces of Oceania. He tried to squeeze out some childhood memory that should tell him whether London had always been quite like this. Were there always these vistas of rotting nineteenth-century houses, their sides shored up with baulks of timber, their windows patched with cardboard and their roofs with corrugated iron, their crazy garden walls sagging in all directions? And the bombed sites where the plaster dust swirled in the air and the willow-herb straggled over the heaps of rubble; and the places where the bombs had cleared a larger patch and there had sprung up sordid colonies of wooden dwellings like chicken-houses? But it was no use, he could not remember: nothing remained of his childhood except a series of bright-lit tableaux occurring against no background and mostly unintelligible.\nThe Ministry of Truth — Minitrue, in Newspeak(1) — was startlingly different from any other object in sight. It was an enormous pyramidal structure of glittering white concrete, soaring up, terrace after terrace, 300 metres into the air. From where Winston stood it was just possible to read, picked out on its white face in elegant lettering, the three slogans of the Party:\nWAR IS PEACE\nFREEDOM IS SLAVERY\nIGNORANCE IS STRENGTH\nThe Ministry of Truth contained, it was said, three thousand rooms above ground level, and corresponding ramifications below. Scattered about London there were just three other buildings of similar appearance and size. So completely did they dwarf the surrounding architecture that from the roof of Victory Mansions you could see all four of them simultaneously. They were the homes of the four Ministries between which the entire apparatus of government was divided. The Ministry of Truth, which concerned itself with news, entertainment, education, and the fine arts. The Ministry of Peace, which concerned itself with war. The Ministry of Love, which maintained law and order. And the Ministry of Plenty, which was responsible for economic affairs. Their names, in Newspeak: Minitrue, Minipax, Miniluv, and Miniplenty.\nThe Ministry of Love was the really frightening one. There were no windows in it at all. Winston had never been inside the Ministry of Love, nor within half a kilometre of it. It was a place impossible to enter except on official business, and then only by penetrating through a maze of barbed-wire entanglements, steel doors, and hidden machine-gun nests. Even the streets leading up to its outer barriers were roamed by gorilla-faced guards in black uniforms, armed with jointed truncheons.\nWinston turned round abruptly. He had set his features into the expression of quiet optimism which it was advisable to wear when facing the telescreen. He crossed the room into the tiny kitchen. By leaving the Ministry at this time of day he had sacrificed his lunch in the canteen, and he was aware that there was no food in the kitchen except a hunk of dark-coloured bread which had got to be saved for tomorrow's breakfast. He took down from the shelf a bottle of colourless liquid with a plain white label marked VICTORY GIN. It gave off a sickly, oily smell, as of Chinese rice-spirit. Winston poured out nearly a teacupful, nerved himself for a shock, and gulped it down like a dose of medicine.\nInstantly his face turned scarlet and the water ran out of his eyes. The stuff was like nitric acid, and moreover, in swallowing it one had the sensation of being hit on the back of the head with a rubber club. The next moment, however, the burning in his belly died down and the world began to look more cheerful. He took a cigarette from a crumpled packet marked VICTORY CIGARETTES and incautiously held it upright, whereupon the tobacco fell out on to the floor. With the next he was more successful. He went back to the living-room and sat down at a small table that stood to the left of the telescreen. From the table drawer he took out a penholder, a bottle of ink, and a thick, quarto-sized blank book with a red back and a marbled cover.\nFor some reason the telescreen in the living-room was in an unusual position. Instead of being placed, as was normal, in the end wall, where it could command the whole room, it was in the longer wall, opposite the window. To one side of it there was a shallow alcove in which Winston was now sitting, and which, when the flats were built, had probably been intended to hold bookshelves. By sitting in the alcove, and keeping well back, Winston was able to remain outside the range of the telescreen, so far as sight went. He could be heard, of course, but so long as he stayed in his present position he could not be seen. It was partly the unusual geography of the room that had suggested to him the thing that he was now about to do.\nBut it had also been suggested by the book that he had just taken out of the drawer. It was a peculiarly beautiful book. Its smooth creamy paper, a little yellowed by age, was of a kind that had not been manufactured for at least forty years past. He could guess, however, that the book was much older than that. He had seen it lying in the window of a frowsy little junk-shop in a slummy quarter of the town (just what quarter he did not now remember) and had been stricken immediately by an overwhelming desire to possess it. Party members were supposed not to go into ordinary shops (‘dealing on the free market’, it was called), but the rule was not strictly kept, because there were various things, such as shoelaces and razor blades, which it was impossible to get hold of in any other way. He had given a quick glance up and down the street and then had slipped inside and bought the book for two dollars fifty. At the time he was not conscious of wanting it for any particular purpose. He had carried it guiltily home in his briefcase. Even with nothing written in it, it was a compromising possession.\nThe thing that he was about to do was to open a diary. This was not illegal (nothing was illegal, since there were no longer any laws), but if detected it was reasonably certain that it would be punished by death, or at least by twenty-five years in a forced-labour camp. Winston fitted a nib into the penholder and sucked it to get the grease off. The pen was an archaic instrument, seldom used even for signatures, and he had procured one, furtively and with some difficulty, simply because of a feeling that the beautiful creamy paper deserved to be written on with a real nib instead of being scratched with an ink-pencil. Actually he was not used to writing by hand. Apart from very short notes, it was usual to dictate everything into the speak-write which was of course impossible for his present purpose. He dipped the pen into the ink and then faltered for just a second. A tremor had gone through his bowels. To mark the paper was the decisive act. In small clumsy letters he wrote:\nApril 4th, 1984.\nHe sat back. A sense of complete helplessness had descended upon him. To begin with, he did not know with any certainty that this was 1984. It must be round about that date, since he was fairly sure that his age was thirty-nine, and he believed that he had been born in 1944 or 1945; but it was never possible nowadays to pin down any date within a year or two.\nFor whom, it suddenly occurred to him to wonder, was he writing this diary? For the future, for the unborn. His mind hovered for a moment round the doubtful date on the page, and then fetched up with a bump against the Newspeak word doublethink. For the first time the magnitude of what he had undertaken came home to him. How could you communicate with the future? It was of its nature impossible. Either the future would resemble the present, in which case it would not listen to him: or it would be different from it, and his predicament would be meaningless.\nFor some time he sat gazing stupidly at the paper. The telescreen had changed over to strident military music. It was curious that he seemed not merely to have lost the power of expressing himself, but even to have forgotten what it was that he had originally intended to say. For weeks past he had been making ready for this moment, and it had never crossed his mind that anything would be needed except courage. The actual writing would be easy. All he had to do was to transfer to paper the interminable restless monologue that had been running inside his head, literally for years. At this moment, however, even the monologue had dried up. Moreover his varicose ulcer had begun itching unbearably. He dared not scratch it, because if he did so it always became inflamed. The seconds were ticking by. He was conscious of nothing except the blankness of the page in front of him, the itching of the skin above his ankle, the blaring of the music, and a slight booziness caused by the gin.\nSuddenly he began writing in sheer panic, only imperfectly aware of what he was setting down. His small but childish handwriting straggled up and down the page, shedding first its capital letters and finally even its full stops:\nApril 4th, 1984. Last night to the flicks. All war films. One very good one of a ship full of refugees being bombed somewhere in the Mediterranean. Audience much amused by shots of a great huge fat man trying to swim away with a helicopter after him, first you saw him wallowing along in the water like a porpoise, then you saw him through the helicopters gunsights, then he was full of holes and the sea round him turned pink and he sank as suddenly as though the holes had let in the water, audience shouting with laughter when he sank. then you saw a lifeboat full of children with a helicopter hovering over it. there was a middle-aged woman might have been a jewess sitting up in the bow with a little boy about three years old in her arms. little boy screaming with fright and hiding his head between her breasts as if he was trying to burrow right into her and the woman putting her arms round him and comforting him although she was blue with fright herself, all the time covering him up as much as possible as if she thought her arms could keep the bullets off him. then the helicopter planted a 20 kilo bomb in among them terrific flash and the boat went all to matchwood. then there was a wonderful shot of a child's arm going up up up right up into the air a helicopter with a camera in its nose must have followed it up and there was a lot of applause from the party seats but a woman down in the prole part of the house suddenly started kicking up a fuss and shouting they didnt oughter of showed it not in front of kids they didnt it aint right not in front of kids it aint until the police turned her turned her out i dont suppose anything happened to her nobody cares what the proles say typical prole reaction they never —\nWinston stopped writing, partly because he was suffering from cramp. He did not know what had made him pour out this stream of rubbish. But the curious thing was that while he was doing so a totally different memory had clarified itself in his mind, to the point where he almost felt equal to writing it down. It was, he now realized, because of this other incident that he had suddenly decided to come home and begin the diary today.\nIt had happened that morning at the Ministry, if anything so nebulous could be said to happen.\nIt was nearly eleven hundred, and in the Records Department, where Winston worked, they were dragging the chairs out of the cubicles and grouping them in the centre of the hall opposite the big telescreen, in preparation for the Two Minutes Hate. Winston was just taking his place in one of the middle rows when two people whom he knew by sight, but had never spoken to, came unexpectedly into the room. One of them was a girl whom he often passed in the corridors. He did not know her name, but he knew that she worked in the Fiction Department. Presumably — since he had sometimes seen her with oily hands and carrying a spanner — she had some mechanical job on one of the novel-writing machines. She was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her. He knew the reason. It was because of the atmosphere of hockey-fields and cold baths and community hikes and general clean-mindedness which she managed to carry about with her. He disliked nearly all women, and especially the young and pretty ones. It was always the women, and above all the young ones, who were the most bigoted adherents of the Party, the swallowers of slogans, the amateur spies and nosers-out of unorthodoxy. But this particular girl gave him the impression of being more dangerous than most. Once when they passed in the corridor she gave him a quick sidelong glance which seemed to pierce right into him and for a moment had filled him with black terror. The idea had even crossed his mind that she might be an agent of the Thought Police. That, it was true, was very unlikely. Still, he continued to feel a peculiar uneasiness, which had fear mixed up in it as well as hostility, whenever she was anywhere near him.\nThe other person was a man named O'Brien, a member of the Inner Party and holder of some post so important and remote that Winston had only a dim idea of its nature. A momentary hush passed over the group of people round the chairs as they saw the black overalls of an Inner Party member approaching. O'Brien was a large, burly man with a thick neck and a coarse, humorous, brutal face. In spite of his formidable appearance he had a certain charm of manner. He had a trick of resettling his spectacles on his nose which was curiously disarming — in some indefinable way, curiously civilized. It was a gesture which, if anyone had still thought in such terms, might have recalled an eighteenth-century nobleman offering his snuffbox. Winston had seen O'Brien perhaps a dozen times in almost as many years. He felt deeply drawn to him, and not solely because he was intrigued by the contrast between O'Brien's urbane manner and his prize-fighter's physique. Much more it was because of a secretly held belief — or perhaps not even a belief, merely a hope — that O'Brien's political orthodoxy was not perfect. Something in his face suggested it irresistibly. And again, perhaps it was not even unorthodoxy that was written in his face, but simply intelligence. But at any rate he had the appearance of being a person that you could talk to if somehow you could cheat the telescreen and get him alone. Winston had never made the smallest effort to verify this guess: indeed, there was no way of doing so. At this moment O'Brien glanced at his wrist-watch, saw that it was nearly eleven hundred, and evidently decided to stay in the Records Department until the Two Minutes Hate was over. He took a chair in the same row as Winston, a couple of places away. A small, sandy-haired woman who worked in the next cubicle to Winston was between them. The girl with dark hair was sitting immediately behind.\nThe next moment a hideous, grinding speech, as of some monstrous machine running without oil, burst from the big telescreen at the end of the room. It was a noise that set one's teeth on edge and bristled the hair at the back of one's neck. The Hate had started.\nAs usual, the face of Emmanuel Goldstein, the Enemy of the People, had flashed on to the screen. There were hisses here and there among the audience. The little sandy-haired woman gave a squeak of mingled fear and disgust. Goldstein was the renegade and backslider who once, long ago (how long ago, nobody quite remembered), had been one of the leading figures of the Party, almost on a level with Big Brother himself, and then had engaged in counter-revolutionary activities, had been condemned to death, and had mysteriously escaped and disappeared. The programmes of the Two Minutes Hate varied from day to day, but there was none in which Goldstein was not the principal figure. He was the primal traitor, the earliest defiler of the Party's purity. All subsequent crimes against the Party, all treacheries, acts of sabotage, heresies, deviations, sprang directly out of his teaching. Somewhere or other he was still alive and hatching his conspiracies: perhaps somewhere beyond the sea, under the protection of his foreign paymasters, perhaps even — so it was occasionally rumoured — in some hiding-place in Oceania itself.\nWinston's diaphragm was constricted. He could never see the face of Goldstein without a painful mixture of emotions. It was a lean Jewish face, with a great fuzzy aureole of white hair and a small goatee beard — a clever face, and yet somehow inherently despicable, with a kind of senile silliness in the long thin nose, near the end of which a pair of spectacles was perched. It resembled the face of a sheep, and the voice, too, had a sheep-like quality. Goldstein was delivering his usual venomous attack upon the doctrines of the Party — an attack so exaggerated and perverse that a child should have been able to see through it, and yet just plausible enough to fill one with an alarmed feeling that other people, less level-headed than oneself, might be taken in by it. He was abusing Big Brother, he was denouncing the dictatorship of the Party, he was demanding the immediate conclusion of peace with Eurasia, he was advocating freedom of speech, freedom of the Press, freedom of assembly, freedom of thought, he was crying hysterically that the revolution had been betrayed — and all this in rapid polysyllabic speech which was a sort of parody of the habitual style of the orators of the Party, and even contained Newspeak words: more Newspeak words, indeed, than any Party member would normally use in real life. And all the while, lest one should be in any doubt as to the reality which Goldstein's specious claptrap covered, behind his head on the telescreen there marched the endless columns of the Eurasian army — row after row of solid-looking men with expressionless Asiatic faces, who swam up to the surface of the screen and vanished, to be replaced by others exactly similar. The dull rhythmic tramp of the soldiers” boots formed the background to Goldstein's bleating voice.

'Gone with the Wind', 'Scarlett O’Hara was not beautiful, but men seldom realized it when caught by her charm as the Tarleton twins were. In her face were too sharply blended the delicate features of her mother, a Coast aristocrat of French descent, and the heavy ones of her florid Irish father. But it was an arresting face, pointed of chin, square of jaw. Her eyes were pale green without a touch of hazel, starred with bristly black lashes and slightly tilted at the ends. Above them, her thick black brows slanted upward, cutting a startling oblique line in her magnolia-white skin—that skin so prized by Southern women and so carefully guarded with bonnets, veils and mittens against hot Georgia suns.\n\nSeated with Stuart and Brent Tarleton in the cool shade of the porch of Tara, her father’s plantation, that bright April afternoon of 1861, she made a pretty picture. Her new green flowered-muslin dress spread its twelve yards of billowing material over her hoops and exactly matched the flat-heeled green morocco slippers her father had recently brought her from Atlanta. The dress set off to perfection the seventeen-inch waist, the smallest in three counties, and the tightly fitting basque showed breasts well matured for her sixteen years. But for all the modesty of her spreading skirts, the demureness of hair netted smoothly into a chignon and the quietness of small white hands folded in her lap, her true self was poorly concealed. The green eyes in the carefully sweet face were turbulent, willful, lusty with life, distinctly at variance with her decorous demeanor. Her manners had been imposed upon her by her mother’s gentle admonitions and the sterner discipline of her mammy; her eyes were her own.\n\nOn either side of her, the twins lounged easily in their chairs, squinting at the sunlight through tall mint-garnished glasses as they laughed and talked, their long legs, booted to the knee and thick with saddle muscles, crossed negligently. Nineteen years old, six feet two inches tall, long of bone and hard of muscle, with sunburned faces and deep auburn hair, their eyes merry and arrogant, their bodies clothed in identical blue coats and mustard-colored breeches, they were as much alike as two bolls of cotton.\n\nOutside, the late afternoon sun slanted down in the yard, throwing into gleaming brightness the dogwood trees that were solid masses of white blossoms against the background of new green. The twins’ horses were hitched in the driveway, big animals, red as their masters’ hair; and around the horses’ legs quarreled the pack of lean, nervous possum hounds that accompanied Stuart and Brent wherever they went. A little aloof, as became an aristocrat, lay a black-spotted carriage dog, muzzle on paws, patiently waiting for the boys to go home to supper.\n\nBetween the hounds and the horses and the twins there was a kinship deeper than that of their constant companionship. They were all healthy, thoughtless young animals, sleek, graceful, high-spirited, the boys as mettlesome as the horses they rode, mettlesome and dangerous but, withal, sweet-tempered to those who knew how to handle them.\n\nAlthough born to the ease of plantation life, waited on hand and foot since infancy, the faces of the three on the porch were neither slack nor soft. They had the vigor and alertness of country people who have spent all their lives in the open and troubled their heads very little with dull things in books. Life in the north Georgia county of Clayton was still new and, according to the standards of Augusta, Savannah and Charleston, a little crude. The more sedate and older sections of the South looked down their noses at the up-country Georgians, but here in north Georgia, a lack of the niceties of classical education carried no shame, provided a man was smart in the things that mattered. And raising good cotton, riding well, shooting straight, dancing lightly, squiring the ladies with elegance and carrying one’s liquor like a gentleman were the things that mattered.\n\nIn these accomplishments the twins excelled, and they were equally outstanding in their notorious inability to learn anything contained between the covers of books. Their family had more money, more horses, more slaves than any one else in the County, but the boys had less grammar than most of their poor Cracker neighbors.\n\nIt was for this precise reason that Stuart and Brent were idling on the porch of Tara this April afternoon. They had just been expelled from the University of Georgia, the fourth university that had thrown them out in two years; and their older brothers, Tom and Boyd, had come home with them, because they refused to remain at an institution where the twins were not welcome. Stuart and Brent considered their latest expulsion a fine joke, and Scarlett, who had not willingly opened a book since leaving the Fayetteville Female Academy the year before, thought it just as amusing as they did.\n\n“I know you two don’t care about being expelled, or Tom either,” she said. “But what about Boyd? He’s kind of set on getting an education, and you two have pulled him out of the University of Virginia and Alabama and South Carolina and now Georgia. He’ll never get finished at this rate.”\n\n“Oh, he can read law in Judge Parmalee’s office over in Fayetteville,” answered Brent carelessly. “Besides, it don’t matter much. We’d have had to come home before the term was out anyway.”\n\n“Why?”\n\n“The war, goose! The war’s going to start any day, and you don’t suppose any of us would stay in college with a war going on, do you?”\n\n“You know there isn’t going to be any war,” said Scarlett, bored. “It’s all just talk. Why, Ashley Wilkes and his father told Pa just last week that our commissioners in Washington would come to—to—an—amicable agreement with Mr. Lincoln about the Confederacy. And anyway, the Yankees are too scared of us to fight. There won’t be any war, and I’m tired of hearing about it.”\n\n“Not going to be any war!” cried the twins indignantly, as though they had been defrauded.\n\n“Why, honey, of course there’s going to be a war,” said Stuart. “The Yankees may be scared of us, but after the way General Beauregard shelled them out of Fort Sumter day before yesterday, they’ll have to fight or stand branded as cowards before the whole world. Why, the Confederacy—”\n\nScarlett made a mouth of bored impatience.\n\n“If you say ‘war’ just once more, I’ll go in the house and shut the door. I’ve never gotten so tired of any one word in my life as ‘war,’ unless it’s ‘secession.’ Pa talks war morning, noon and night, and all the gentlemen who come to see him shout about Fort Sumter and States’ Rights and Abe Lincoln till I get so bored I could scream! And that’s all the boys talk about, too, that and their old Troop. There hasn’t been any fun at any party this spring because the boys can’t talk about anything else. I’m mighty glad Georgia waited till after Christmas before it seceded or it would have ruined the Christmas parties, too. If you say ‘war’ again, I’ll go in the house.”\n\nShe meant what she said, for she could never long endure any conversation of which she was not the chief subject. But she smiled when she spoke, consciously deepening her dimple and fluttering her bristly black lashes as swiftly as butterflies’ wings. The boys were enchanted, as she had intended them to be, and they hastened to apologize for boring her. They thought none the less of her for her
